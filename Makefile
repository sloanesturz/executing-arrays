#
# A simple makefile for building project composed of C source files.
#
# Julie Zelenski, for CS107, Sept 2012

# It is likely that default C compiler is already gcc, but be explicit
# anyway
CC = gcc

# The CFLAGS variable sets the flags for the compiler.  CS107 uses these
# flags:
#  -m32        emit code for IA32 architecture
#  -g          compile with debug information
#  -O0         do not optimize generated code
#  -std=gnu99  use the C99 standard language definition with GNU
# extensions
#  -W<various> configures which diagnostic warnings are given
CFLAGS = -m32 -g -O0 -std=gnu99 -z execstack

# The LDFLAGS variable sets the flags for the linker. CS107 uses these
# flags:
#       -m32    emit code for IA32 architecture
LDFLAGS = -m32

# The line below defines the variable 'programs' to name all of the
# programs
# to be built by this makefile.
programs = silly

# The line below defines a target named 'all', configured to trigger the 
# build of everything named in the 'programs' variable. The first target 
# defined in the makefile becomes the default target. When make is invoked 
# without any arguments, it builds the default target.
all : $(programs)

# Specific per-target customizations and prerequisites are listed here
# The spellcheck program uses functions from cvecmap lib so needs to
# include it
# as a prerequisite





# The line below defines the clean target to remove any previous build
# results
clean:
	rm -f $(programs) core *.o

# PHONY is used to mark targets that don't represent actual files/build
# products
.PHONY: clean all
